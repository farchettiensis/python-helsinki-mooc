# The Project 
This repository contains my solutions to the University of Helsinki's Python Programming [MOOC](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/)'s exercises. Its main purpose is to keep track of my progress and motivate myself to see it through. I've had little to no Python knowledge prior to starting this course.

## The Program
The Python Programming course has 14 parts. 

Parts 1-7 are part of the **Introduction to Programming** section.

Parts 8-14 belong to the **Advanced Course in Programming** section.

I will add dates when I finish each of the two courses.
